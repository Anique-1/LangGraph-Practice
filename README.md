# LangGraph Practice

Welcome to the **LangGraph Practice** repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the capabilities of [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a powerful open-source library for building advanced, stateful AI workflows using graph-based intelligence.

---

## What is LangGraph?

**LangGraph** is a framework that enables developers to create complex, stateful AI applications by representing workflows as graphs. It integrates the power of large language models (LLMs) with the flexibility of graph structures, allowing for dynamic, context-aware, and highly modular agentic workflows. LangGraph is part of the LangChain ecosystem and is designed to facilitate sophisticated decision-making, memory management, and tool integration in AI agents.

---

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Workflows:** Model your AI logic as nodes (functions/agents) and edges (connections/conditions), supporting cycles, branches, and complex flows.
- **State Management:** Maintain and share agent state across nodes and edges, enabling context retention and error recovery.
- **Tool Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate external tools, APIs, and databases to enhance agent capabilities.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Support for human intervention and oversight within workflows.
- **Scalability & Modularity:** Easily scale and modify workflows by adding or updating nodes and edges.

---

## Core Concepts

- **Nodes:** Discrete computation units (functions, agents, or tool calls) in the workflow.
- **Edges:** Connections between nodes, which can be direct or conditional (if-else logic).
- **Conditional Edges:** Enable dynamic routing based on state or context.
- **State:** Shared context/data that flows through the graph, allowing memory and continuity.
- **Tools:** External actions or APIs the agent can use.
- **Agents:** Autonomous units that traverse the graph, make decisions, and interact with tools.
- **Paths:** Sequences of nodes and edges followed to achieve a goal.

---

## Real-World Use Cases

LangGraph is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of AI applications, including:

- **Customer Support Agents:** Handle complex, multi-step customer interactions with context retention and dynamic decision-making.
- **Content Generation Pipelines:** Automate content creation, review, and editorial workflows.
- **Healthcare Diagnostic Assistants:** Analyze patient symptoms, assess risk, and provide recommendations with compliance and security.
- **Educational Tools:** Build adaptive learning assistants that personalize content and feedback.
- **Research Assistants:** Summarize and extract insights from large datasets or documents.

## Example: Customer Service Bot (LangGraph)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage
from typing import Dict, List, Any

class CustomerServiceState(TypedDict):
    conversation_history: List[Dict]
    customer_context: Dict
    issue_status: str
    escalation_required: bool

def create_customer_service_bot():
    graph = StateGraph()
    llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.7)

    def classify_issue(state: CustomerServiceState) -> CustomerServiceState:
        messages = [
            SystemMessage(content="Classify the customer issue into one of these categories: billing, technical, product, other"),
            HumanMessage(content=state["conversation_history"][-1]["message"])
        ]
        response = llm.predict_messages(messages)
        return {
            **state,
            "issue_type": response.content,
            "status": "classified"
        }

    def handle_billing_issue(state: CustomerServiceState) -> CustomerServiceState:
        if "payment" in state["conversation_history"][-1]["message"].lower():
            return {**state, "escalation_required": True}
        return state

    def generate_response(state: CustomerServiceState) -> CustomerServiceState:
        context = f"Previous conversation: {state['conversation_history']}\nIssue type: {state['issue_type']}"
        response = llm.predict(context + "\nGenerate helpful response")
        return {
            **state,
            "conversation_history": state["conversation_history"] + [{"role": "assistant", "message": response}]
        }

    graph.add_node("classify", classify_issue)
    graph.add_node("billing", handle_billing_issue)
    graph.add_node("respond", generate_response)

    def route_by_issue(state):
        return state["issue_type"].lower()

    graph.add_conditional_edges(
        "classify",
        route_by_issue,
        {
            "billing": "billing",
            "technical": "respond",
            "product": "respond",
            "other": "respond"
        }
    )

    return graph.compile()
```

## Best Practices

- **Modularity:** Break down workflows into reusable nodes and edges.
- **Monitoring:** Implement logging and error handling for reliability.
- **Security:** Ensure data protection and compliance (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare).
- **Scalability:** Design graphs to handle increased workloads and parallel processing.
- **Integration:** Connect with existing systems and APIs for richer functionality.
